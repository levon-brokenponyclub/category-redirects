# Sisi Workwear Redirects

### Description
This plugin automatically redirects any URL under `/workwear/` to the site homepage using a **307 Temporary Redirect**. It logs all redirects, tracks timestamps, and provides a dedicated admin page called **Sisi Redirects** where administrators can:

- **Scan the site** for all existing `/workwear/` URLs (including posts, pages, and products).
- **Redirect all found URLs immediately** without waiting for user visits.
- **View a complete table** of all `/workwear/` URLs, showing:
  - Original URL
  - Redirect target (homepage)
  - Status (redirected or not yet redirected)
  - Timestamp of the redirect

The plugin ensures site visitors and search engines are temporarily redirected while keeping a clear log for admins.
